# Contributing

This is a quick overview for what you should know when contributing to this Git repository.

 - There is a code style guide in `arweave_styleguide.md`. Please note that we're using tabs for indentation.
 - Make sure the tests pass (see [README](README.md) for how to run the tests).
 - You can discuss development and get help from the Arweave organization and community in the `#dev` channel on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/3UTNZky).

## Workflow

 1. Fork the main Git repo `https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git`
 2. Branch out from `master`.
 3. Add your changes.
 4. Run the tests (see above).
 5. Rebase your branch on the upstream `master` if the upstream `master` has moved since you branched out.
 6. Create a PR back to the upstream `master`.

Happy hacking! :)
